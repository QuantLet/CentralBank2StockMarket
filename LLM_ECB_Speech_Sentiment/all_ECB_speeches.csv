2025-01-27|Christine Lagarde|Central bank independence in an era of volatility|Lamfalussy Lecture by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Lamfalussy Lectures Conference organised by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, pre-recorded in Frankfurt am Main on 15 January 2025|  SPEECH  Central bank independence in an era of volatility   Lamfalussy Lecture by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Lamfalussy Lectures Conference organised by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, pre-recorded in Frankfurt am Main on 15 January 2025 Budapest, 27 January 2025 In his later years, Alexandre Lamfalussy was once asked what his fundamental motivation in life was. He recalled the experience of his turbulent youth, surrounded by the destruction caused by the Second World War.[1] “In the aftermath of the war,” Lamfalussy said, “I decided to serve the community in the rebuilding of Europe.”[2]  He went on to do just that. A member of the Delors Committee and the first President of the European Monetary Institute, Lamfalussy helped pave the way for Europe’s monetary union and the establishment of the ECB. His generation had also been scarred by the difficulties of the “Great Inflation” in the 1970s.[3] And so Lamfalussy – alongside other architects of the euro[4] – ensured that the ECB would have sufficient powers to prevent a scenario where inflationary expectations once again became embedded in the economy. We can see proof of this today, as advanced economies emerge from the largest inflation shock in a generation. As in the 1970s, a series of shocks contributed to high and persistent inflation. But unlike the 1970s, inflation has since fallen relatively fast across advanced economies – and expectations have remained firmly anchored throughout. This hard-won progress has been in large part due to the independence of central banks, which has given them the ability to take difficult but necessary monetary policy decisions in pursuit of stable prices. The rise of central bank independence In the late twentieth century, central bank independence spread rapidly around the world.  A strong social consensus about its benefits – emerging from the negative experience of the 1970s – sparked what Lamfalussy would later call a “sea change” in monetary policymaking.[5]  By one account, over 80% of the world’s central banks became operationally independent by the turn of the millennium.[6] And price stability had been adopted as the primary objective of monetary policy frameworks across almost all advanced economies and many emerging market economies.[7]  Moreover, independent central banks both contributed to – and benefited from – a period of low macroeconomic volatility.  In their famous paper, Alesina and Summers found a positive relationship between the degree of independence of central banks and lower and less volatile inflation outcomes.[8] At the same time, substantial structural changes were afoot in the global economy, which also helped to reduce macroeconomic volatility – an era that soon came to be known as the Great Moderation.[9]  Globalisation led to an enormous increase in both global labour supply and production capacity, which meant that prices and wages were often little affected even in the face of strong demand. And the oil crises of the 1970s had sparked a wave of change in global energy markets, resulting in a more elastic energy supply. The upshot of the Great Moderation was a virtuous circle.  An environment of low macroeconomic volatility made it easier for independent central banks to deliver on their price stability mandates. That, in turn, solidified the social consensus in support of central bank independence and helped ensure its growing adoption around the world – further contributing to lowering levels of volatility. The era of volatility The end of the Great Moderation came suddenly and unexpectedly in 2008 with the arrival of the global financial crisis. And over the last years in particular, our world has changed dramatically.  Indeed, the two forces that fostered the spread of central bank independence – a strong social consensus and growing pools of global supply – are now coming under increasing pressure.  While recent research suggests that de jure central bank independence has never been more prevalent than it is today[10], there is no doubt that the de facto independence of central banks is being called into question in several parts of the world. One study examining 118 central banks in the 2010s shows that around 10% of them faced political pressure in an average year – even those central banks with a high degree of de jure independence.[11] Another paper finds that between 2018 and 2020 alone, de facto central bank independence deteriorated for almost half of those central banks in jurisdictions accounting for 75% of global GDP.[12]  There is evidence to suggest that political influence on central bank decisions can also contribute substantially to macroeconomic volatility. For instance, persistent political pressure on a central bank has been found to affect the level and the volatility of exchange rates, bond yields and the risk premium.[13]  At the same time, geopolitical tensions threaten to amplify volatility by increasing the frequency of shocks hitting the global economy.  We have already seen the impact of geopolitical tensions play out in Europe. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, average output growth volatility in the euro area surged by 60% compared with before the global financial crisis, while average inflation volatility shot up by 280%.[14]  An environment of heightened volatility could make the task of maintaining price stability more difficult to achieve.[15] This could raise concerns that independent central banks are failing to deliver on their mandates, which could undermine the social consensus and further amplify volatility in the economy. So, the question that comes to the fore is: will the current era of volatility turn the virtuous circle that facilitated the rise of central bank independence into a vicious circle that leads to it being undermined? The benefits of central bank independence in today’s world All things considered, I would argue that this is unlikely to happen.  A volatile macroeconomic environment actually makes the benefits of central bank independence all the greater. We saw this during the recent inflation shock.  In OECD countries, average annual inflation surged to 9.6% in 2022 as they faced a variety of shocks that compounded each other.[16] In response, independent central banks sharply increased policy rates.  These actions led to a rapid decline and convergence in the respective inflation paths of major economies – despite all these economies facing different shocks. Moreover, inflation expectations have remained firmly anchored, suggesting that the public continues to have faith in independent central banks’ commitment to price stability over the long run.[17]  In today’s world, central bank independence offers two key advantages.  First, it acts as a headwind to volatility in these unpredictable times. As we emerge from a period of very high inflation, the issue of time inconsistency is more relevant than ever.[18] Compared with the pre-pandemic era of low inflation, central banks may need to contend with lower levels of rational inattention.[19]  In this environment, credible policy regimes become even more important for maintaining trust in central banks. Research finds that higher trust in the ECB lowers inflation expectations on average and significantly reduces uncertainty about future inflation.[20]  Second, central bank independence also contributes to regional strength in a world increasingly defined by geopolitical rivalries. Price stability provides the foundation upon which other strategic goals can be achieved. Regions with stable prices tend to have more efficient resource allocation and higher levels of competitiveness, and they attract greater levels of investment. At heart, strong economic institutions are the fundamental cause of long-run economic growth and development differences between regions.[21]  Conclusion Lamfalussy once described the task of launching the euro as “navigating in uncharted waters”.[22] In an era of volatility, independent central banks now also find themselves in unfamiliar waters. While inflation has fallen sharply, central banks are still likely to face a more volatile macroeconomic environment compared with the Great Moderation. It therefore remains imperative that central banks have the independence to fully deliver on their price stability mandates. Thank you.

Including Türkiye. See OECD, “Inflation (CPI)”.     This speaks to Lamfalussy’s own prescient observation in the lead-up to the creation of the ECB. He argued that the new central bank “will have no track record of its own … This implies that financial markets and the general public will assess the performance of the ECB on the basis of the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework adopted and the ability to act in accordance with its primary objective.” See Lamfalussy, A.

The outlook was then still being shaped by the easing of pandemic-related supply constraints and by the energy price shock. Inflation had fallen rapidly from its peak in autumn 2022, but we needed to keep monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely and sustainable return of inflation to our 2% target. Today, the euro area is in a very different place. Having cut interest rates four times since last June, by a total of 100 basis points, we have made substantial progress in bringing inflation back to target. At the same time, the balance of macroeconomic risks has shifted from concerns about high inflation to concerns about low growth. The outlook is clouded by even higher uncertainty, driven by potential global trade frictions, macroeconomic fragmentation, geopolitical tensions and fiscal policy concerns in the euro area. As the new year starts, it is imperative to work towards resolving the various conflicts happening in the world. Today I will outline how the Governing Council is taking this uncertainty into account in its assessment of the inflation and growth outlook, and how a sound financial system is vital in supporting monetary policy. I will then explain the rationale behind the monetary policy decisions that we took in December and how we will approach policy decisions over the coming months. Inflation     The good news is that the disinflation process is well on track. Headline inflation came down quickly in 2023 from the double-digit figures we saw at the end of 2022, as the impact of energy and supply-side shocks faded. The decline in 2024 was more gradual but clearly in the right direction, with inflation averaging 2.4% over the year. The slight increase in inflation in December owing to energy-related base effects had been expected. Core inflation also declined over the past two years, falling from 5% in 2023 to 2.8% in 2024. Most measures of underlying inflation continue to suggest that inflation will settle near our 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. One of these measures, our Persistent and Common Component of Inflation, for example, which has the best predictive power for headline inflation over the one to two-year ahead horizon, has been around 2% for more than a year. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, has edged down, but it remains high (at more than 4%) mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation with a delay. Wage growth has also been moderating. The December Eurosystem staff projections expect inflation to average 2.1% in 2025 and to return sustainably to our target rather early in the projection horizon. Economic activity The outlook for the euro area economy, however, remains weak and subject to significant uncertainty. Output grew above expectations in the third quarter of 2024. This was mainly driven by an increase in consumption, which partly reflect one-off factors that boosted tourism over the summer, and by firms building up inventories. The latest information suggests that the economy is losing momentum. Surveys indicate that manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing, as still-high energy prices, regulatory costs and the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening continue to bite. Firms are holding back on investments, and exports remain weak, with some European industries struggling to remain competitive. The labour market remains resilient, with employment growing in the third quarter of 2024, again by more than expected, and the unemployment rate remaining at its historical low of 6.3% in October. Overall, the December projections see growth in 2024 at 0.7%. Looking ahead, the conditions are in place for growth to strengthen over the projection horizon, although less than was forecast in previous rounds. As the catching up of wages continues and as inflation falls, rising real wages should lead to stronger household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption and investment. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should also support the recovery as global demand rises. Growth is projected to be just above 1% in 2025 and to move slightly up to modest levels in 2026 and 2027. Nevertheless, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. In particular, the outlook is characterised by high uncertainty around future trade policies in the United States, political and fiscal policy uncertainty in some large euro area countries as well as global geopolitical risks. In fact, over the past year the European Commission’s uncertainty index has reached its highest level to date. Furthermore, with formal budget submissions from several euro area countries still pending, projecting the future fiscal policy stance is challenging. This environment of very high uncertainty could dent confidence and dampen the recovery in consumption and investment. Such pessimism is visible, for instance, in consumer expectations. While real household income increased both in 2023 and 2024 according to national accounts, only little more than a third of respondents to our latest Consumer Expectations Survey see their real income as having increased or at least stayed the same. Whereas only about 10% of households indicate an increase in perceived real income, in reality more than half of the households surveyed experienced an increase in their real income, when inflation is netted out from their self-reported nominal income.[2]  Financial stability In this volatile economic environment, we see elevated financial stability vulnerabilities.  High valuations and concentrated risks leave financial markets vulnerable to adverse dynamics, which could be exacerbated by non-banks. Non-bank financial intermediaries have remained resilient to recent bouts of market volatility, supporting market-based finance in the euro area. However, broader market shocks could trigger sudden investment fund outflows or margin calls on derivative exposures. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales amplifying the fall in asset prices. While generally limited, pockets of elevated financial and synthetic leverage in some entities, like hedge funds, may add to spillover risks. Simultaneously, sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing. Despite recent reductions in debt-to-GDP ratios in some euro area countries, fiscal challenges persist in several others. They are exacerbated by heightened policy and geopolitical uncertainty and structural issues such as sluggish potential growth. We therefore need to keep monitoring risks to financial stability carefully, including those stemming from recent increases in sovereign yields in the United States, the United Kingdom and, though more moderate, in the euro area. On a more positive note, euro area banks are strong. Their resilience has been underpinned by solid capital ratios, robust liquidity buffers and high bank profitability. The latter may have reached its peak, however, as net interest margins are already declining while credit losses are gradually rising.  In this uncertain macro-financial environment, preserving bank resilience remains crucial. Existing releasable macroprudential capital buffer requirements and adequate borrower-based measures should be maintained to ensure that banks can absorb any future shocks. At the same time, the policy framework for non-banks should be improved from a macroprudential perspective to strengthen the sector’s resilience. Finally, to mitigate the current risks to sovereign debt sustainability, it is important to implement the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully, transparently and without delay. Given the structural challenges related to low potential growth, the consolidation of public finances will need to be designed in a growth-friendly way.[3]  Conclusion Let me conclude. In December we decided to further moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction, lowering the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are also continuing the process of balance sheet normalisation. In December the last repayment of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations was completed and reinvestments were discontinued. We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-term target. Given the high level of uncertainty, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. The high level of uncertainty calls for prudence. In particular, severe global trade frictions could increase the fragmentation of the world economy, uncertainty about fiscal policy and its present challenges could weigh on borrowing costs, and renewed geopolitical tensions could affect energy prices. We are therefore not pre-committing to a particular rate path. If the incoming data confirm our baseline, the policy trajectory is clear, and we expect to continue to further reduce the restrictiveness of monetary policy.

2024-12-18|Philip R. Lane|The euro area outlook and monetary policy|Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, MNI Webcast|  SPEECH  The euro area outlook and monetary policy   Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, MNI Webcast Frankfurt am Main, 18 December 2024 Introduction The Governing Council last week decided to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – from 3.25 per cent to 3.0 per cent. This decision was justified by our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In my remarks, I would like to discuss these three elements of our reaction function.[1] [2]  The inflation outlook The December Eurosystem staff projections expect headline inflation to average 2.4 per cent in 2024, 2.1 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026. It is then projected to increase to 2.1 per cent in 2027 as a result of the expanded EU Emissions Trading System. The projections continue to foresee a rapid decline in core inflation, from 2.9 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 2027. Compared to the September 2024 macroeconomic projections exercise (MPE), the projections have been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in 2024 and 2025 for headline inflation, and in 2026 for core inflation.  The latest Survey of Monetary Analysts is broadly in line with the December projections for headline inflation. Market-based indicators of inflation compensation are also consistent with a timely return of inflation to target, while also showing a marked compression in inflation risk premia. This may suggest that markets have revised downwards the risk of future adverse supply shocks and revised upwards the risk of future adverse demand shocks. The economic outlook plays a central role in determining the inflation outlook. The incoming information suggests a slowdown in the near term. Looking ahead, conditions are in place for growth to strengthen over the forecast horizon. According to the staff assessment, while structural factors have weighed on the euro area economy, especially the manufacturing sector, the weak productivity growth since 2022 has also included a significant cyclical component, largely driven by the past tightening of monetary policy and weak external demand. Domestic demand should therefore benefit from rising real wages, the gradual fading of the effects of restrictive monetary policy and the ongoing recovery in the global economy. Although fiscal policies are set to remain on a consolidation path overall, funds from the Next Generation EU programme will still support investment in the next two years.  On the external side, euro area export growth is expected to benefit from strengthening foreign demand. At the same time, trade uncertainty has increased materially and the effects of a potential increase in tariffs on the euro area economy will depend on the extent, timing and magnitude of tariff and non-tariff measures, as well as on the responses of the EU and other countries. The labour market remains resilient. Employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, again surprising to the upside, and the unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.3 per cent in October. However, labour demand continues to soften. The job vacancy rate declined to 2.5 per cent in the third quarter, 0.8 percentage points below its peak, and surveys also point to fewer jobs being created in the current quarter. According to the December Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth is expected to average 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. Compared to the September projections, real GDP growth has been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in 2024 and 2025. The latest Survey of Monetary Analysts indicates a lower growth profile than the staff projections for 2025, 2026 and 2027.  The inflation outlook also encompasses the assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline path. The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected . It could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster, which would also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly could drive up food prices by more than expected. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more uncertain. Underlying inflation The indicators of underlying inflation with the highest predictive power are developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target;in particular, the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) measure remains at around 2.0 per cent. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at 4.2 per cent, it remained high, reflecting strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices have still been adjusting to the past inflation surge. At the same time, the incoming information points to a moderation in services inflation dynamics, which should support an easing of domestic inflation. The three-month-on-three-month seasonally adjusted services inflation rate fell to 2.6 per cent in November from 3.4 per cent in October, indicating a further softening in momentum. Meanwhile, the sizeable gap between services inflation and its medium-term underlying trend – captured by the PCCI for services, which stands at 2.5 per cent – suggests there should be further downward adjustment in services inflation in the coming months.  The incoming wage data broadly confirm our previous assessment of elevated but easing wage pressures. The growth rate of compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7 per cent in the second quarter, 0.1 percentage points below the December projection. The growth rate of unit labour costs eased to 4.3 per cent from 5.2 per cent. Profit margins continue to buffer the impact of elevated labour costs on inflation: annual growth in unit profits remained negative in the third quarter. Forward-looking wage trackers continue to point to a material easing of wage growth in 2025. The strength of monetary policy transmission Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the perceived worsening of the economic outlook and the consequent repricing of policy rate expectations. Our past interest rate cuts – together with the anticipation of future cuts – are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow. The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages has also come down, to 3.6 per cent in October, around half a percentage point below its peak in 2023. But financing conditions remain restrictive. The cost of new credit for firms is elevated in historical comparison, particularly in real terms, and the cumulative tightening of credit standards since the beginning of the hiking cycle remains elevated. The average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is set to rise as loans granted at fixed rates reprice at higher levels. Bank lending to firms has only gradually picked up, from subdued levels, with the annual rate of increase rising to 1.2 per cent in October. The annual growth rate of debt securities issued by firms stood at 3.1 per cent in October, remaining within the narrow range observed over recent months. Mortgage lending continued to drift up gradually, to an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent in October. Conclusion In summary, the incoming information and the latest staff projections indicate that the disinflation process remains well on track. While domestic inflation is still high, it should come down as services inflation dynamics moderate and labour cost pressures ease. Recent policy rate cuts are also gradually transmitting to funding costs, but financing conditions along the entire transmission chain, starting with the level of our policy rate and including the market interest rates that financial intermediaries charge on credit to households and firms, remain restrictive.  This assessment explains the decision to lower the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points. Looking to the future, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty, it is prudent to maintain agility on a meeting-by-meeting basis and not pre-commit to any particular rate path. In terms of risk management, monetary easing can proceed more slowly compared to the interest rate path embedded in the December projections in the event of upside shocks to the inflation outlook and/or to economic momentum. Equally, in the event of downside shocks to the inflation outlook and/or to economic momentum, monetary easing can proceed more quickly. All else equal, the rate path will also be influenced by our ongoing assessment of underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.         A slide deck to accompany these remarks is available on the ECB website.

2024-12-16|Isabel Schnabel|Navigating towards neutral|Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the CEPR Paris Symposium 2024 hosted by the Banque de France|  SPEECH  Navigating towards neutral   Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the CEPR Paris Symposium 2024 hosted by the Banque de France Paris, 16 December 2024 Monetary policy is at a critical juncture.  Growing confidence in a sustainable decline of inflation towards our 2% target has allowed the Governing Council to remove substantial policy restriction over the past six months. With our decision last week to cut the three key policy rates by a further 25 basis points, the deposit facility rate is now at 3%, one percentage point below its peak.  Today I will argue that, with interest rates approaching neutral territory and with risks to the inflation outlook broadly balanced, monetary policy should proceed gradually and remain data-dependent.  In this way, we can ensure that disinflation does not stall above our 2% target, while avoiding unnecessary weakness in the labour market and the economy at large. I will also argue that, once price stability has been restored, the challenges for monetary policy will change. As inflation becomes dominated by idiosyncratic shocks again, central banks can afford to be more tolerant of moderate deviations from target – in both directions. Staff projections confirm nearing return to price stability Incoming data and the new Eurosystem staff projections have confirmed that the disinflation process remains well on track. Inflation is now expected to decline towards our 2% target in the course of 2025 and to oscillate around this level over the projection horizon, as domestic price pressures ease and base effects from energy prices fade (Slide 2, left-hand side). Growth has been revised down but is still expected to accelerate next year, as consumption and investment recover on the back of rising real incomes and less restrictive financing conditions (Slide 2, right-hand side).  As ECB staff continue to project that the euro area economy will expand at a pace around its potential growth rate in the coming years, inflation should neither over- nor undershoot our 2% target materially over the projection horizon once past shocks have fully unwound. Three factors support the assumptions underlying this projected recovery.  One is the upside surprise to growth in the third quarter, with private consumption picking up and inventories no longer weighing on growth (Slide 3, left-hand side). A turnaround in the inventory cycle would remove a significant drag on aggregate demand. Second, confidence in the retail trade sector as well as consumer expectations for major purchases over the next twelve months continued to improve in November, while savings intentions declined somewhat (Slide 3, right-hand side). Third, according to model-based analyses, over the next twelve months an economic expansion is still much more probable than a recession, despite the prospect of more trade barriers clouding the euro area economic outlook (Slide 4, left-hand side). Although the baseline forecast does not incorporate the potential impact of concrete policy measures of the new Trump administration, as these remain uncertain, recent sentiment indicators are likely to partially reflect the surge in trade policy uncertainty already (Slide 4, right-hand side). Empirical research suggests that, rather than the actual tariff increase itself, it is the rise in uncertainty that will be the main drag on growth. But these effects are often estimated to be short-lived, with growth rebounding sharply once uncertainty fades.[1]  Gradual removal of policy restriction remains appropriate The staff projections are therefore consistent with bringing interest rates to a neutral setting as inflation stabilises sustainably around our 2% target. The question then is how fast we should remove policy restriction. Our decision last week to cut our key policy rates by 25 basis points reflects the conviction that a gradual and data-dependent approach remains the most appropriate strategy.[2]  There are three reasons for this. Dot the i's and cross the t's First, while we are increasingly confident that price stability is within reach, an important part of disinflation has yet to materialise. Services inflation, in particular, remains high at 3.9%. At the same time, momentum indicators, such as the three-month-on-three-month rate, suggest that price pressures have started to ease. But such signals critically depend on the way the seasonal adjustment is done.  For example, shifts in households’ consumption patterns in the wake of the pandemic may be making the seasonal adjustment more difficult. Estimates by financial market participants suggest that, when correcting for these potential shifts, momentum could be measurably higher than what our current estimates imply.[3]  Indeed, over the past two years, November has turned out to be a notable outlier in terms of the month-on-month change in services inflation (Slide 5, left-hand side). Also, while the baseline scenario assumes a cyclical recovery in productivity growth that is expected to ease the growth in unit labour costs, hysteresis effects or other structural factors could weigh on productivity and investment over an extended period of time. Recent scenario analysis conducted by ECB staff shows that, in that case, growth would be lower and inflation higher – 0.3 percentage points cumulatively by 2026 – than in the baseline (Slide 5, right-hand side).[4] These effects would rise notably if the forces weighing on productivity growth were more permanent. So, even if most of the evidence points to continued disinflation, we should remain alert to signs that cast doubt on our baseline. A gradual approach allows us to react to such signs. Balance of risks can shift as new shocks materialise Second, new shocks keep hitting the euro area economy, many of them posing upside risks to inflation. Gas prices, for example, have doubled since February (Slide 6, left-hand side). As a result, wholesale electricity prices have increased substantially. Food prices, too, have started rising at a concerning pace, at an annualised three-month-on-three-month rate of 4.6% in November, up from 0.9% in May (Slide 6, right-hand side). Moreover, climate mitigation measures are increasingly affecting prices over the medium term.  In 2027, for example, Eurosystem staff expect inflation to rise above 2%, mainly due to the planned expansion of the EU emissions trading system to buildings, road transport and small industry (ETS2).[5]  In addition, while the direction and persistence of the various effects of potential tariffs on inflation are ambiguous, their net effect is often estimated to be positive.  While a decline in foreign demand for euro area goods as well as trade diversion, especially from China, are likely to be disinflationary, several channels could mitigate or even offset these forces. For example, the EU may retaliate with tariffs of its own, as it did in 2018. Also, the parallel impulse to the US economy coming from expansionary fiscal and supply-side policies could support foreign demand, even as tariffs increase, because many products are not substitutable in the short run.  Finally, since the end of September the euro has depreciated by more than 6% against the US dollar, largely in anticipation of the incoming US administration’s economic policy intentions. This is already putting upward pressure on import prices. Such inflationary shocks are of particular concern in the current environment, as people are paying more attention to inflation after recent experiences. The latest Eurobarometer reveals that inflation remains people’s biggest concern in most euro area countries.[6] This attention makes inflation expectations more vulnerable after a long period of high inflation. Proceeding gradually allows us to respond to new shocks in an environment of elevated uncertainty and volatility.  Data dependence needed to assess the degree of policy restriction Third, a gradual approach is the most appropriate course of action the closer we are getting to neutral territory. There are two related sets of benchmarks for monetary policy. One is simple Taylor-type policy rules that are used in most structural models to replicate the systematic response of monetary policy to movements in inflation and growth. While such rules need to be treated with caution, they are a useful policy benchmark. As there are many ways such rules can be formulated and estimated, it is helpful to use a thick-modelling framework that reduces some of the data and model uncertainty. Such a framework currently suggests that the median rule points to a gradual dialling back of policy restriction (Slide 7). It also suggests that the distribution of projected interest rate outcomes is skewed to the upside.  The second benchmark is the natural real rate of interest, r*. There is no consensus on what its main drivers are, or on how to best estimate it. As a result, the range of estimates is exceptionally large, both within and across models. Recent analysis by ECB staff across a suite of models suggest that the point estimate of r* ranges from about -0.5% to 1%, or about 1.5% to 3% in nominal terms.[7] This is similar to recent estimates by economists from the Bank for International Settlements.[8]  Significant parameter uncertainty makes it even more challenging to use the natural rate as a guidepost for monetary policy. In this uncertain environment, it is helpful to focus on what has changed in recent years to understand whether real equilibrium rates could be higher today than during the 2010s. An increase would warrant a more cautious approach by central banks removing policy restriction. Changes in the demand for and supply of global savings suggest that equilibrium rates may have increased in recent years. The pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other shocks have led to an increase in public debt around the world (Slide 8, left-hand side). Net borrowing by governments remains substantial. In 2024, the public deficit will be around 5% of GDP across advanced economies and it is expected to decline only marginally in the coming years, also reflecting borrowing requirements associated with the digital and green transitions (Slide 8, right-hand side).  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that, in the coming years, overall global investment – public and private – will reach the highest share in GDP since the 1980s. It is likely that, as a result, real interest rates need to rise to clear the global market for savings. This may especially be the case as rising geopolitical fragmentation contributes to reducing the supply of savings, including those provided by price-insensitive investors. In the United States, for example, the decline in the share of foreign official holdings of US Treasury securities has accelerated in recent years (Slide 9, left-hand side). It is now at the lowest level in more than twenty years.[9]  Incidentally, since about late 2022, asset swap spreads started to widen measurably in both the euro area and the United States, suggesting that investors are gradually demanding a higher return to warehouse the supply of global public bonds (Slide 9, right-hand side).[10]  These developments are contributing to the reversal of the global savings glut, which put notable downward pressure on real rates for the greater part of the 21st century.[11]  This has repercussions for the assessment of the monetary policy stance. For example, given the notable increase in real short-term rates expected to prevail in the distant future, which are often taken as proxies for the natural rate, the policy stance today may already be in neutral territory, as real spot rates have started to fall below their equilibrium levels (Slide 10). Other indicators point in a similar direction. In our most recent bank lending survey, for example, 93% of banks report that the general level of interest rates no longer plays a role in explaining weak loan demand. This contrasts sharply with a year ago when almost half of the banks said that interest rates were a factor contributing to lower loan demand. Similarly, the survey on the access to finance of enterprises shows that the pressure from interest expenses is gradually easing. The net percentage of firms indicating an increase in interest expenses fell from 36% to 19%, reaching similar levels to those recorded at the end of 2021. Finally, among households, we have observed a notable turnaround in the demand for housing loans. A net 39% of banks reported higher demand in the third quarter, a share close to the historical peak of 45% and well above the historical average (Slide 11, left-hand side). This increase in the demand for housing loans is broad-based across countries. Banks expect it to continue, reflecting both the decline in mortgage rates and improving housing market prospects. In the second quarter, the euro area house price index rose for the first time in more than a year (Slide 11, right-hand side). Return to price stability requires different conduct of monetary policy All this suggests that we should proceed with caution and remain data-dependent, assessing at each monetary policy meeting whether disinflation remains on track and whether, and to what extent, interest rates remain restrictive. In doing so, we can continuously cross-check the assumptions underlying the staff projections and thereby retain a forward-looking perspective. This is especially important at a time when past pandemic-related shocks are starting to recede, and new shocks are increasingly driving price and wage dynamics. This shift in regime – from a high-inflation environment to one where inflation is consistent with price stability – has two important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.[12]  The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the inflation regime One is that it has a direct impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy. The success of central banks in paving the way towards restoring price stability after the recent inflation surge has a lot to do with how monetary policy works. In a high-inflation regime, price increases tend to reflect factors common to most goods and services. This is what has happened in recent years. The common component of inflation rose sharply as firms reacted to the combination of higher energy prices, supply-side bottlenecks and pent-up demand after the pandemic-induced lockdowns. This was reflected in the rapid broadening of inflation pressures across the goods and services contained in the consumption basket (Slide 12). Ultimately, these shocks affected all sectors of the economy, especially when second-round effects pushed wage demands higher across firms. Wage-price spirals are often the clearest sign of a regime shift, when changes in the general price level become a coordination device for price and wage setters. As monetary policy affects aggregate demand as well as the inflation expectations of both firms and households, it is powerful in counteracting such common shocks (Slide 13, left-hand side).  As this process is nearing completion and we are re-entering a regime of price stability, idiosyncratic price shocks that reflect relative price changes, and that are mostly independent of each other, will again dominate in driving aggregate inflation. This is reflected in the measurable decline of the common component. Idiosyncratic price changes, however, tend to be less responsive to changes in aggregate demand and hence to changes in monetary policy (Slide 13, right-hand side). As a result, monetary policy becomes less effective in steering overall inflation.  Central banks then need to carefully weigh the benefits and costs of trying to lean against relative price shocks. The strongest case for acting is when prices start to co-move again, either because of a new large shock or a series of shocks that move prices in the same direction. But in the absence of such shocks, policy should be careful not to overreact. This is especially the case if idiosyncratic shocks reflect structural forces. While it is inherently difficult to separate cyclical from structural factors, surveys among firms suggest that a significant part of the current weakness in parts of our economy relates to forces outside the realm of monetary policy. In our latest corporate telephone survey, for example, firms reported that the recent decline in business sentiment was driven by growing concerns about political developments, both in Europe and globally, and waning competitiveness amid high energy costs and the green transition. Firms expressed concerns about rising regulatory costs, such as those resulting from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). Compliance with these and other directives is seen as complex and resource-intensive, especially for smaller firms.[13]  In other cases, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, there is mounting concern that regulation is increasingly stifling innovation and competition, especially in important areas such as AI.[14]  Particularly in Germany and France, these structural headwinds are causing businesses to postpone, or even refrain from, transformative investments and focus instead on efficiency and cost-cutting, which, in turn, is weighing on consumer confidence and spending. An expansionary monetary policy stance will change this dynamic only marginally, if at all.  Recent research by Òscar Jordà, Sanjay Singh and Alan Taylor corroborates this view.[15] It shows that, while the effects of tight monetary policy can be persistent, central banks cannot boost potential output by bringing rates into expansionary territory (Slide 14, left-hand side).  And while the benefits of using monetary policy to deal with idiosyncratic shocks are likely to be limited, the welfare costs that it has for society can be significant. One of the costs is that relative price adjustments support the efficient allocation of resources within the economy. Leaning too strongly against them in the absence of clear risks to price stability may inhibit this process. The other is that valuable policy space is lost and so will not be available to support employment and growth when the economy faces shocks that monetary policy can deal with more effectively.  This was the case when the pandemic hit. At that time, interest rates were already close to their effective lower bound. As a result, central banks needed to resort to unconventional policy instruments. However, the effectiveness of such measures in stimulating aggregate demand is more uncertain, while their potential side effects are larger.[16]  Greater tolerance for moderate deviations of inflation from target The second implication is that, when relative price shocks dominate, inflation is largely self-stabilising. As a result, central banks can have a greater tolerance for moderate deviations of inflation from target, in both directions. The reason is that the impact of changes in aggregate demand on inflation is weaker in an environment in which price changes are largely independent from each other. That is, the Phillips curve is highly non-linear: its slope is often steep when inflation is high, and it is flat when inflation is low.[17]  In this environment, it takes a large shock to aggregate demand for inflation to measurably and persistently drift away from the economy’s nominal anchor – our 2% target. So there is less need for policy to respond to moderate shocks.  This is especially true for disinflationary shocks. Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that nominal wage cuts are extremely rare and that the frequency at which firms adjust prices lower is highly stable over time (Slide 14, right-hand side).[18]  And when prices and wages do not chase each other as they did over the past years, inflation is largely self-stabilising. As such, the risk of falling into a truly harmful deflationary spiral is limited. Monetary policy can then be more patient and allow inflation to deviate from target for longer than in a situation in which risks of second-round effects are larger.[19]  This can also be seen in the historical properties of commodity price shocks.  When oil prices fell sharply and persistently in 2014, the pass-through to consumer prices and wages was moderate. Underlying inflation, while weak, never fundamentally drifted away from our 2% target.  But in 2022, when inflation was already rising on the back of the repercussions of the pandemic, firms raised their prices considerably and much more frequently than when inflation was low and stable. Conclusion   Let me now conclude with three main take-aways. First, price stability is within reach. Considering the risks and uncertainties we are still facing, lowering policy rates gradually towards a neutral level is the most appropriate course of action. Second, once price stability has been restored in a sustainable manner, the behaviour of inflation will change such that central banks can afford to tolerate moderate deviations of inflation from target, in both directions.  Given limited policy space, monetary policy should focus on responding forcefully to shocks that have the capacity to destabilise inflation expectations by pushing inflation measurably and persistently away from our 2% target over the medium term. Third, monetary policy is not a supply-side instrument. It cannot resolve structural issues that durably weigh on price pressures, as was the case during the 2010s, when a highly accommodative monetary policy stance over a long period was unable to lift the economy out of the low-growth, low-inflation environment. Structural policies are the responsibility of governments. Thank you.      Bloom, N. (2009), “The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks”, Econometrica, Vol. 77(3), pp. 623-685.     Lagarde, C.

2024-12-16|Christine Lagarde|Monetary policy in the euro area|Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Bank of Lithuania’s Annual Economics Conference on “Pillars of Resilience Amid Global Geopolitical Shifts”, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of euro introduction, Vilnius, Lithuania|  SPEECH  Monetary policy in the euro area   Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Bank of Lithuania’s Annual Economics Conference on “Pillars of Resilience Amid Global Geopolitical Shifts”, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of euro introduction, Vilnius, Lithuania Vilnius, 16 December 2024 It is an honour to be here today to mark 10 years of Lithuania in the euro. “Laisvė, Vienybė, Gerovė” – freedom, unity and well-being. These are core national values in Lithuania – and accordingly, they are engraved in the edge-lettering on Lithuania’s €2 coin.  Freedom, because of the liberation from Soviet occupation. Unity, because of the need for national solidarity. And well-being, expressing hope for economic and social prosperity.  These three words capture the spirit of the Lithuanian people. And I believe that being part of the euro has strengthened each of them. The country is now an equal partner in setting monetary policy by one of the world’s most important central banks in the third largest economy, the euro area. That gives Lithuania freedom in charting its own macroeconomic destiny that smaller economies cannot typically claim, who often have to import the monetary policy of their larger neighbours.  Lithuania now also issues the world’s second most important reserve and invoicing currency. That provides unity in the face of a more volatile world, as foreign shocks do not penetrate the domestic economy as much, owing to domestic currency invoicing. Lithuania is especially resilient on this front, invoicing 78% of its exports to non-member countries in euros last year, the fourth highest share across the EU. And being part of the euro has increased the well-being of the Lithuanian people. When Lithuania joined the euro area in 2015, GDP per capita in purchasing power standard terms was around 70% of the euro area average. By 2023, it exceeded 83%. But more recently, the country has dealt with very high inflation, peaking at 22.5% in September 2022 – more than double the peak seen in the euro area as a whole.  This high-inflation episode has led to a pronounced monetary policy cycle, with the ECB raising rates by 450 basis points, holding them steady for 9 months, and then cutting rates by 100 basis points since June as we entered the “dialling back” phase of our policy.  However, even in this “dialling back” phase, until recently we retained a restrictive bias in our future policy orientation. At our last meeting, we dropped that bias. Today, I would like to explain what motivated this change and what it implies for the future. In a nutshell, we have seen the environment change in three important ways that increase our confidence that inflation is returning to our target. These changes concern the path of inflation, the shocks driving inflation and the risks to inflation.  The path of inflation The first important change relates to the path of inflation. In the earlier part of our monetary policy cycle, the path of inflation was characterised by high uncertainty. We consistently saw the return of inflation to target in our projections being pushed back. At the same time, the incoming inflation data were surprising on the upside, casting further doubt on the accuracy of those projections.  ECB staff models using machine learning[1] indicate that in 2022 and 2023 uncertainty around inflation forecasts was around four to five times higher than in the long-term average.  This uncertainty about the inflation path had implications for the policy horizon – that is, the period within which we want to see inflation converging to our target. Normally, the medium-term policy horizon is flexible and can be extended depending on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks. But if there is a risk of inflation expectations becoming de-anchored, the horizon must be shortened to the nearest possible date that monetary policy can take effect to prevent that risk materialising – which given normal transmission lags is around two years. With inflation rising and its return to target continually being pushed back, at a certain point we considered that the risk of de-anchoring had become too high. So, in September 2022 we introduced the notion that the return of inflation to our target had to be “timely”. Our aim was to fix the policy horizon and thereby build confidence among the public that there would be no more delays.  Now, after a lengthy period of restrictive policy, our confidence that we are seeing a “timely” return to target has increased. Since September last year, we have had six consecutive forecast rounds showing inflation returning to target in the course of 2025. And this arrival date has stayed constant even as we have drawn closer to it.  The uncertainty around these projections has decreased significantly. Our machine learning models now put the uncertainty bands at close to pre-pandemic levels.  The incoming data have, over time, validated the path laid out in the forecasts. Since early 2023, the accuracy of staff projections has returned to the levels seen pre-COVID, especially for headline inflation. While errors for core inflation have taken longer to normalise, this year they have also returned to historical standards.  And this confidence is confirmed in inflation expectations. Among households, median expectations for inflation three years ahead are close to 2%, and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have also fallen in recent months.  The shocks driving inflation The second change in the environment relates to the shocks driving inflation.  The major challenge for monetary policy during this cycle is that we have faced a sequence of very large shocks which – given staggered wage- and price-setting in the euro area – have transmitted through the economy in persistent and hard-to-forecast ways.  So, even as our confidence in our projections increased, we had to be careful in making our policy stance less restrictive too quickly. We needed a policy framework that would allow us to better understand this complex inflation process. That is why we built our reaction function around our well-known three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. Focusing on the dynamics of underlying inflation allowed us to extract more robustly the trend in inflation based on the data we could see in front of us, complementing the information provided by our forecasts.  And for a given inflation path, assessing the strength of monetary transmission allowed us to judge whether our tightening impulse was being passed on through the transmission chain and was thus effective in steering inflation back towards 2%. This forward-looking framework has provided a way of broadening our information set to capture the pace at which a very large past shock – 10.6% inflation at its peak – was running its course, and how our monetary policy stance was transmitting through the economy and affecting medium-term inflation.  For some time, the signals from underlying inflation were still flagging the risk that inflation might not decline as quickly as indicated in our forecasts. But recently this risk has declined and there is now greater alignment between our forecasts and underlying inflation. The width of the range of measures of underlying inflation that we monitor has narrowed towards its historical average, with most indicators hovering between 2% and 2.8%, which we take as an indicator of receding uncertainty on future inflation dynamics. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which has the best predictive power for future inflation, has remained at around 2% since the end of last year. There is one measure that is still above this range, which is domestic inflation, capturing items with a low import content. But this is a year-on-year measures that is made up 97% of services items, and so it is still registering repricing events that took place earlier this year that are keeping services inflation around 4%.  However, if we look at the PCCI for services, which strips out base effects, the measure currently stands at 2.5%. Inflation momentum for services has also dropped steeply recently. These data suggest that there is scope for a downward adjustment in services inflation, and thereby domestic inflation, in the coming months.    Confirming this picture, wage growth – which is the main cost factor driving services – is on a downward trajectory and continues to be buffered by negative growth in unit profits, buffering the pass-through of rising wages to prices.  The ECB wage tracker – which captures wage agreements in seven euro area countries representing around 85% of total wages in the euro area – sees wage growth slowing from 4.8% this year to around 3% in 2025, the level we generally consider to be consistent with our target. The risks to inflation The third change in the environment relates to the risks to inflation. The fact that past shocks were expected to travel slowly along the pricing chain meant that, in recent years, the risks to inflation were mostly to the upside. And despite the progress we have seen in underlying inflation, these risks have not disappeared entirely. The composition of inflation remains unbalanced, with the recent slowdown being driven mostly by energy inflation, which is particularly volatile, and industrial goods. The adjustment process for slower-moving services inflation is still unfinished. So, we will have to remain watchful until the downward adjustment in services inflation that we expect is confirmed by the data. However, as past shocks fade, the risks to the inflation outlook have changed. And crucially, these risks are now related more to potential future shocks than to the transmission of past ones.   The main downside risks relate to the weaker-than-expected growth outlook and the increased uncertainty surrounding growth triggered by geopolitical events. For some time now, we have been seeing small sequential downward revisions to the growth outlook which have cumulatively amounted to a quite significant downgrade over time. For example, if we go back to our June 2023 projections, we expected average growth of 1.5% in 2024. Now, we expect 0.7%. One driver of this delayed recovery has been sluggish export growth, driven by the competitive challenges facing euro area companies. But the most important driver of our growth forecast misses has been the domestic economy. In fact, around half of the misses since end-2021 relate to investment and a quarter relate to consumption. The behaviour of investment can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the stronger-than-expected impact of higher interest rates, higher energy prices and structural deterrents. The inertia in consumption has been striking given that the conditions for a recovery are in place. Employment is historically high and real incomes are rising. But households continue to save an unusually high share of their income and take a cautious approach to spending. One reason for this caution is that many households have a perception of their real income growth that is well below measured data. Just 37% of households in our consumer survey believe that their real income has risen or stayed the same, even though 50% of all households have experienced actual increases. And these households have significantly lower consumption growth than those with correct perceptions.  This pessimism about real incomes is largely driven by past inflation, and so in principle it should dissipate as the high-inflation episode moves further into the rearview mirror.[2] But increasing geopolitical uncertainty could create new dents in household sentiment. In particular, if the United States – our largest export market – takes a protectionist turn, growth in the euro area is likely to take a hit. Our exporters also specialise in capital goods that other countries use for export production, which makes them particularly sensitive to shifts in confidence about world trade.  The main upside risks we see in the future also relate to external shocks. A rise in geopolitical tensions could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, while extreme weather events could drive up food prices. The net effect of trade fragmentation and tariffs on inflation remains uncertain, as it involves assumptions that are impossible to anticipate with precision. These include potential retaliatory actions as well as exchange rate and commodity price movements. Implications for monetary policy So what does this changing environment mean for our monetary policy? There are three main implications. The first concerns our current policy stance and its future orientation. The current policy stance is restrictive. But if the incoming data continue to confirm our baseline, the direction of travel is clear and we expect to lower interest rates further.  In terms of the future orientation, we previously said that “we will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary”. This bias was necessary in an environment of high realised inflation and high uncertainty about future inflation. But it no longer reflects the evolving macroeconomic landscape, our outlook for inflation or the balance of risks around it.  With the disinflation process well on track, and downside risks to growth, this bias in our communication is no longer warranted. These considerations are reflected in the monetary policy statement adopted by the Governing Council last week. We no longer aim for “sufficiently restrictive” policy, but rather intend to deliver an “appropriate” policy stance.  The second implication for monetary policy concerns our reaction function.  The high-inflation period has proven the value of the three criteria we have been using to take decisions, which is why the Governing Council confirmed this policy framework at last week’s meeting. And these criteria will be invaluable in the period ahead, even as the risks to inflation move from past shocks to future ones. In an uncertain environment, we will need to continue complementing our baseline outlook with a rich distribution of possible risks derived from current data. But our framework is flexible, in the sense that we can change the weight we put on the different legs of our reaction function depending on the nature of the shocks we are facing. For example, if we face large geopolitical shocks that significantly increase uncertainty about the inflation projections, we will need to draw on other sources of data to make the risk assessment surrounding our baseline outlook more robust. At the same time, the purpose of monitoring underlying inflation is to help us differentiate noise in the inflation data from underlying trends. So, if underlying trends are not affected, it will help increase confidence in the baseline projection.  And assessing monetary transmission will continue to be important, as geopolitical uncertainty may affect monetary transmission by altering the risk appetite of investors, borrowers and financial intermediaries. The third implication concerns the policy horizon. Even though we are not there yet, we are close to achieving our target. So, we are no longer in a situation where we need to fix the policy horizon at the shortest possible transmission lag. We can return to a situation where the policy horizon can adjust depending on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks as needed. This change explains why we have removed the notion of “timeliness” from our monetary policy statement, focusing instead on achieving “sustainable” inflation convergence. And it puts us in the best position to react to future shocks. Conclusion Let me conclude.  The Lithuanian poem “The Seasons” (Metai), written by Kristijonas Donelaitis, charts the cyclical nature of the rural life of Lithuanians. The ECB is also moving through its monetary policy cycle, and we are now at a stage where the darkest days of winter look to be behind us, and we can start to look forward instead. We certainly hope that the days ahead will be better. But winds are blowing in different directions and there is much uncertainty before us. So, our monetary policy will be prepared for all scenarios to come.

2024-12-04|Christine Lagarde|Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament|Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament|  SPEECH  Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament   Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Brussels, 4 December 2024   I am pleased to return to this Committee to discuss the ECB’s monetary policy at such a critical juncture for Europe.  We are witnessing a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape, but also enduring major structural challenges to our economic model.  Europe’s response must be swift. It should focus on spurring investment, fostering innovation and raising productivity. This will require bold policy action and, together with the new European Commission and the Council, this Parliament will have an important role to play. In my remarks today, I will discuss an important element of this response – the new economic governance framework – which you have chosen as one of the topics of this hearing. But I would like to start by updating you on the ECB’s assessment of the euro area economy and our monetary policy stance.  The economic outlook and the ECB’s monetary policy stance The euro area saw moderate growth in the first half of this year, following five quarters of stagnation. Real GDP growth was largely driven by exports and government consumption. Domestic private demand remained weak amid high economic policy uncertainty and the effects of past monetary policy tightening. More recently, in the third quarter, real GDP rose by 0.4%, driven in part by temporary factors such as the Paris Olympics. However, survey-based data suggest that growth will be weaker in the short term, on the back of slowing growth in the services sector and a continued contraction in manufacturing. Further ahead, the euro area’s economic recovery should start to gather some steam. Consumer spending is expected to pick up as real incomes rise, and investment is expected to recover as the impact of past monetary policy tightening fades.  The euro area labour market has so far proven resilient. The unemployment rate remained historically low at 6.3% in October, while employment expanded by 300,000 jobs in the third quarter. At the same time, surveys point to slowing employment growth and further moderation in the demand for labour. The medium-term economic outlook is uncertain, however, and dominated by downside risks. Geopolitical risks are elevated, with growing threats to international trade. High degrees of trade openness and integration into global supply chains make the euro area vulnerable to foreign shocks, with potential trade barriers posing threats to manufacturing and investment. Turning to inflation, headline inflation increased further to 2.3% in November from 2.0% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. The increase in the last two months – following a deceleration in previous months – was driven mainly by a moderation in the fall in energy prices and an increase in food inflation.  Core inflation – excluding energy and food – remained unchanged at 2.7% in November and is expected to hover around current levels until early 2025. Services inflation remains the biggest contributor to inflation and stood at 3.9% in November, driven in part by recent high wage growth. Overall, growth in labour costs has been moderating in recent quarters – notwithstanding the volatility of negotiated wage growth over the summer – and is set to continue easing. Domestic inflationary pressures are also receding as profits have been buffering still elevated labour cost developments.  Looking ahead, inflation is expected to temporarily increase in the fourth quarter of this year, as previous sharp falls in energy prices drop out of the annual rates, before declining to target in the course of next year.  Let me now turn to our monetary policy stance. In October the ECB lowered its key interest rates by 25 basis points, following the previous rate cuts in June and September. The information available at our October meeting confirmed that the disinflationary process was well on track. Our deposit facility rate, the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance, now stands at 3.25%.  We will review our stance again next week, following our data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. We are therefore not pre-committing to a particular rate path. The new economic governance framework Let me turn now to the second topic you have chosen for our hearing today – the EU’s new economic governance framework. Fiscal policy is essential to address the multiple challenges Europe is currently facing, ranging from the green and digital transitions to economic security and defence. But for fiscal policy to be credible and powerful, it also needs to rest on strong foundations.  The EU’s new economic governance framework strikes a balance between ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and fostering strategic investments and growth-enhancing reforms. If implemented effectively, it will provide three major benefits. First, it can help address the challenges related to elevated debt levels, which have partly arisen from policies designed to buffer the impact of recent crises across the economy. The framework focuses on debt sustainability, thereby also supporting monetary policy transmission.  Second, the framework strives to balance gradual and sustained fiscal consolidation with incentives for much-needed investment and structural reforms. It introduces the possibility of extending fiscal adjustment paths from four to seven years. Such extensions are contingent on growth-enhancing investments and reforms being implemented, which would in turn further strengthen debt sustainability by raising potential growth. Reducing high debt levels also increases the space for strategic investments at the national and European levels. Third, the new framework can help to make the fiscal stance more countercyclical, smoothing out economic fluctuations and thereby supporting long-term growth in conditions of price stability.  Implementing the revised economic governance framework fully and transparently is thus key to safeguarding Member States’ capacity to invest now and in the future.  The challenges we face also require us to rethink the EU’s role in addressing strategic investment needs. As Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi observed in their reports, Europe is currently falling short of its potential. A key idea running through the reports is that Europe is bigger than its constituent parts. Well-defined joint EU investments would boost potential growth and contribute to macroeconomic stability. They would allow us to harness economies of scale and address cross-border challenges, to the benefit of all Europeans, adding value beyond what national investments could achieve alone. They would also send a strong signal of unity to private investors within and outside the EU.  Such investments must be accompanied by coordinated and ambitious reform efforts. At the EU level, completing the capital markets union, which we discussed in my previous hearing before this committee, and deepening the Single Market are essential. Member States also play a crucial role in reducing obstacles to entrepreneurship, helping firms to innovate and grow and aiding the efficient allocation of capital and labour. Progress towards closer European integration paired with national reform efforts is essential for a more dynamic and competitive economy – one that supports citizens’ standards of living and enables businesses to thrive. Conclusion Let me now conclude.  Europe’s geopolitical and structural challenges require coordinated and determined action from policymakers. As the Greek storyteller Aesop wisely said, “In union there is strength”, and citizens’ trust in the European Union is at its highest level in over 15 years.[1] The Commission has set an ambitious policy agenda to tackle these challenges, which you have endorsed. It is now up to you to make it happen. The ECB will play its role in supporting Europe’s longer-term sustainable growth by fulfilling its mandate of price stability. Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to your questions.      European Commission (2024), Standard Eurobarometer 102 - Autumn 2024.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
